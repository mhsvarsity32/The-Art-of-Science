// Writing 2000 lines of code in one file is a challenging task. This code will be based on the principles of The Art of Science, a book that focuses on the power of using mathematics to solve real-world problems. 

// This code will demonstrate how to use Rust to solve a number of mathematical problems in a concise and efficient manner. These problems will range from basic data structures and algorithms to more advanced topics such as Monte Carlo simulation methods. 

// The code will first consist of a series of functions that will help facilitate the solving of the problems. This will include functions for calculating factorials, Fibonacci numbers, prime numbers, and various other mathematical operations.

// Additionally, the code will also include various types of data structures, such as linked lists and hash tables, as well as algorithms, such as sorting and searching algorithms. These data structures and algorithms will prove key in solving the various mathematical problems in an efficient manner. 

// After completing the functions and data structures, the code will then move onto solving actual problems. This will include finding the greatest common divisor, calculating the probability of an event occurring, and determining the most efficient route in a graph. 

// Finally, the code will explore more advanced topics such as Monte Carlo simulation, Markov chains, and dynamic programming. These more advanced topics will offer insight into more complicated mathematical problems, which will prove essential in solving real-world problems. 

// The code will conclude by demonstrating how the knowledge and techniques learned over the course of the project can be put to use in solving real-world problems. In doing so, this code will provide a strong foundation for further exploration into the mathematics of The Art of Science.
